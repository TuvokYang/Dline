/**
 * CheckpointMutexRegistry — Process-Level Mutex Manager
 *
 * Manages a pool of Mutex instances keyed by cwdHash. All checkpoint
 * operations that access the same shadow git repository (identified by
 * cwdHash) are serialized through the same Mutex, preventing race
 * conditions when multiple Tasks (e.g. parent + spawned children) or
 * multiple VS Code windows operate on the same workspace concurrently.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - Mutexes are created lazily on first access for a given cwdHash.
 * - They live for the lifetime of the process (no explicit cleanup).
 *
 * Thread-safety:
 * - p-mutex is Promise-based and serializes async operations within
 *   the Node.js event loop; no additional synchronization is needed.
