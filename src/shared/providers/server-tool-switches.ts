 * Server tool availability is the intersection of two independently owned facts:

 * - the model registry declares which hosted tools a model can run, and
 * - the profile records which of those the user switched off.
 *
 * Keeping the switch in its own list is what lets an empty list keep its natural
 * meaning ("nothing is turned off"). Storing the switch back into the declaration
 * would make "off" indistinguishable from "this model has no such capability",
 * which is how a hosted-capable model silently loses its hosted route.
