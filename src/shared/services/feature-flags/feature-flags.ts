 * Experimental capability switches.
 *
 * These were once remote rollout flags. The flags that existed only to let an
 * upstream service steer this extension — model list sources, promotional
 * banners, onboarding overrides — have been removed, so what remains are local
 * switches for capabilities that are not yet ready to be on for everyone.
 *
 * The enum string values are the persisted identity of each switch and are also
 * what the environment variable names are derived from, so they must not be
 * changed casually.
