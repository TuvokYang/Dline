 * Whether a task in this phase can still reach a queue delivery point.

 * the queue there would hide it from the user with nothing left to send it.
 *
 * Deliberately wider than `isTaskWorkingPhase` in
 * `@core/task/TaskActivityPhases`: a task parked on an approval still resumes
 * afterwards and will reach a delivery point, so queued input stays valid
 * there even though the loop is not advancing on its own.
 *
 * Written as a phase list rather than a negated list of terminal phases: a new
 * phase should have to opt in to holding the user's input, not inherit it.
