/**
 * Per-task running counts used to emit "so far in this task" histograms.
 *
 * These counts are shared: turns and errors are observed by the task recorder
 * while tool calls are observed by the tool recorder, yet all three reset
 * together when a task starts, restarts, or ends. Giving them one owner is what
 * keeps a reset from being applied by one recorder and missed by another.
 *
 * Entries are cleared at task boundaries, but a task can be abandoned without
 * ever reaching one — the user closes the window mid-run, or starts a new task
 * without completing the old one. A capacity bound turns that from an unbounded
 * leak into a fixed cost, at the price of under-counting a task that has been
 * dormant for longer than `MAX_TRACKED_TASKS` other tasks.
