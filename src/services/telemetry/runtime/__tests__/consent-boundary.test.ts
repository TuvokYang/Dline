/**
 * WS-017 / AC-031 — VER-RTD-006-CONSENT-BOUNDARY.
 *
 * Runtime diagnostics and product analytics now share one `LoggerProvider`.
 * That is an efficiency, not a merge of permissions: sharing export
 * infrastructure must not let one subsystem's consent decision start the other.
 *
 * The risk this pins down is specific. `unset` means the user has not yet
 * answered the reporting prompt. If sharing a provider ever made runtime
 * telemetry start on someone else's consent, the extension would write a
 * journal of the user's activity and open a collector connection before being
 * allowed to — a silent privacy regression that no type or lint check would
 * catch. So the assertions are about observable side effects: files on disk and
 * records handed to an exporter.
