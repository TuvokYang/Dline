/**
 * Turns recorded events into named causes while the session is running.
 *
 * The correlator and the analyzer were built as pure functions over events, so
 * something has to feed them. This is that seam. It lives in the analysis
 * package rather than in the lifecycle because deciding *what counts as a
 * failure* is an analysis concern; the lifecycle only owns sinks and consent.
 *
 * Cost is bounded by design. Every event costs one ring-buffer append; the rule
 * set runs only for events that report a failure or a breached budget, which
 * are rare by construction. Diagnostics must never become the reason the
 * extension host is busy — that is the problem this subsystem exists to find.
