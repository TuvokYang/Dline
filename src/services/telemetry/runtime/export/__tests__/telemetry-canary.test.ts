 * A canary sweep of the diagnostic bundle: feed values that must never leave
 * the machine through a live pipeline, then assert the exported bundle carries
 * none of them.
 *
 * The exporter's own unit tests redact hand-built events, so they choose their
 * own input and cannot show that the events a running pipeline produces are
 * the shape the redactor handles. Recording through the real service and
 * exporting its real buffer is the only way to cover that seam.
 *
 * Scope: the journal and the OTLP body are sinks owned by the transport layer,
 * not by the exporter. They are read here to prove the producer emitted the
 * canaries at all — otherwise a bundle with no canaries would prove nothing —
 * but redaction is asserted only for the bundle.
