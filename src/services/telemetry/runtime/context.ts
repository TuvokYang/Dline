 * is why `capture` and `restore` exist: the caller keeps the identity it had
 * when the continuation was scheduled.
 *
 * Precedence is explicit > ambient > session fallback. An explicit value wins
 * because a producer that names its context knows more than the surrounding
 * stack, for example when reporting on behalf of another task.
