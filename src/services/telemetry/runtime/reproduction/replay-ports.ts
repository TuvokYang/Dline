 * report is not the user who chose to run that command, call that MCP tool, or
 * write that file.
 *
 * The guarantee is structural rather than contractual. `resolveReplayPort`
 * returns one of a closed set of module-private simulators, and the runner
 * takes a policy rather than an implementation, so a caller cannot supply an
 * object that performs real work and then reports `simulated: true`. Adding a
 * new capability means adding a simulator here, where it is reviewable,
