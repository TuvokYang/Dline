/**
 * Replays a recorded scenario through a simulator selected by policy.
 *
 * The runner is deliberately thin: it classifies each step, hands it to the
 * port, and reports what the port returned. The caller chooses a policy rather
 * than supplying a port, so "a scenario cannot touch the machine" holds even
 * when the caller is careless: there is no seam through which a real terminal,
 * client, socket, or file system can be injected.
 *
 * Timing is reported, never awaited. Sleeping through the original delays
 * would make replaying an incident as slow as the incident itself and would
 * add nothing: the recorded duration is already in the step.

/**
 * Effect classification for a step, derived from its component name.
 *
 * Keys are the component names a bundle actually carries. `buildScenarioSteps`
 * derives an absent component from the event name, and `PerfDomain` spells
 * those in snake_case (`terminal_pool`, `settings_repository`), so a map that
 * only knew camelCase would refuse to replay the scenarios this codebase
 * produces. Both spellings are listed rather than normalised, because
 * normalising would also fold apart names that a reviewer intended to keep
 * distinct. `DiagnosticDomain` contributes a few further names — `storage`,
 * `hook`, `task`, `workspace` — that no performance domain spells.
