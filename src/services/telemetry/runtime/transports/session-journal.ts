/**
 * Append-only record of one extension host session's runtime events.
 *
 * A CPU or hang investigation happens after the fact, so the events must
 * outlive the in-memory bus. The journal is deliberately a plain JSON Lines
 * file: it survives a crashed host, can be truncated safely at line
 * boundaries, and needs no schema migration to read.
 *
 * Each line is an OTLP log record rather than the internal event shape, so a
 * standard collector can tail this directory with a `filelog` receiver and a
 * `json_parser` operator. Storing the private shape would have forced every
 * reader to carry a Dline-specific adapter to read data the collector already
 * knows how to interpret.
 *
 * Writing is best-effort. Diagnostics must never be the reason a task fails,
 * so every failure is counted rather than propagated.
