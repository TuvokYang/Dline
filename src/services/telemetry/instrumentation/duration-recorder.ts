/**
 * Single entry point for recording how long a runtime phase took.
 *
 * The shape is deliberately "acquire a handle, then stop it" rather than
 * "compute a duration, then report it". A call site that computes the duration
 * itself must read the clock and build an attribute object before it can know
 * whether anyone is listening, which is exactly the cost telemetry must not
 * impose when it is switched off. Here, `startPerfPhase` returns a shared
 * no-op handle while telemetry is disabled, so the disabled path performs no
 * clock read, no object allocation, and no string interpolation.
 *
 * Measurements leave through the pipeline port rather than a runtime queue, so
 * this module stays independent of whichever pipeline is installed.
