 * unlike `duration-recorder` there is no handle to hold open: the fact is
 * complete at the moment it is observed. What the two share is the disabled
 * contract — when recording is off this returns before building any attribute
 * object, so a call site pays a boolean check and nothing else.
 *
 * Recording is gated by the same predicate as performance recording. Splitting
 * the switches would let a user disable timings while diagnostics kept flowing,
 * which is not a distinction the telemetry setting offers.
