/**
 * Delivers each record only to the processors registered for its scope.
 *
 * Sharing a `LoggerProvider` between product analytics and runtime diagnostics
 * is only safe if each destination still sees exactly the records it is allowed
 * to see. A provider broadcasts every record to every registered processor, so
 * attaching both subsystems directly would send runtime diagnostics — task
 * identifiers, command names, error stacks — to whichever collector an
 * organization configured for product statistics. The workstream contract
 * forbids exactly that.
 *
 * The instrumentation scope is the right discriminator because the SDK stamps
 * it on the record at emit time from the logger that produced it, so a producer
 * cannot spoof it by setting an attribute.
 *
 * Routing is table-driven rather than one wrapper per subsystem because the SDK
 * offers no way to unregister a processor. A subsystem whose consent is revoked
 * and later granted again must be able to detach and re-attach; with fixed
 * wrappers each cycle would leave a dead processor behind and register a
 * duplicate alongside it.
 *
 * Routes are keyed by scope *and* by an owner id because one scope can have
 * several independent destinations: product analytics may report to a
 * user-configured collector and an organization-configured one at the same
 * time. Keying by scope alone would make the second registration evict the
 * first, silently stopping delivery to a collector that was still configured.
