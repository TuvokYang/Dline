 * The one `LoggerProvider` shared by product analytics and runtime diagnostics.
 *
 * The two subsystems previously each built their own provider, resource and
 * export stack. Consolidating them means a single service identity reaches the
 * backend and one place configures export, instead of two that could disagree.
 *
 * Sharing a provider does not merge the data: every subsystem attaches its own
 * processors under its own instrumentation scope, and the router delivers a
 * record only to the processors registered for the scope that produced it.
 * Consent therefore stays per-subsystem — attaching one has no effect on the
 * other, and detaching one leaves the other running.
 *
 * The provider is created on first attach rather than at import time so a host
 * where no subsystem is permitted to report never builds one at all.
