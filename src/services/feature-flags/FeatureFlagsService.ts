 * Answers which experimental capabilities are switched on.
 *
 * The switches were once fetched from a remote flag service, so reads were
 * served from a cache that a `poll()` on the sign-in path filled — a caller on
 * a hot path could not await a request. That also meant the switches only ever
 * resolved for signed-in users.
 *
 * Resolution is local now, so reads resolve on demand and fill the snapshot
 * lazily. The snapshot is kept so that repeated reads within a session agree
 * with each other even if the environment changes underneath.
 *
 * Deliberately independent of telemetry consent and of the account: a
 * capability must not depend on whether the user is measured or signed in.
