/**
 * `Panel created: undefined` was reported as a defect, but it is not one: a
 * panel opened for a new task has no task id yet, and the id arrives later
 * through setPendingTaskId. The log printed the raw value, so an ordinary
 * state was indistinguishable from a lost identifier and sent the
 * investigation after a symptom that did not exist.
 *
 * This is asserted against the source rather than through a running panel:
 * the message is produced inside VSCode panel construction, which a unit test
 * cannot stand up. What matters is that the two cases are named separately,
 * and that no other code reads the old text.
