	description: `[TURN-END] Present a COMPLETE implementation or design plan covering ALL user requirements. Available in both ACT and PLAN modes. In ACT MODE, use this tool only when the user explicitly requests a plan. In PLAN MODE, use it after thorough exploration and analysis when ready to present the plan. Your response MUST include the full plan with detailed analysis, architecture decisions, and a complete task_progress checklist organized with a required # Title and optional ## Section headings covering every step needed to fulfill ALL requirements. Do not simplify or omit parts of the plan - the user needs to see the entire plan to review it. Do not call repeatedly - use qna_respond for questions and discussion.
However, if while writing your response you realize you need more exploration before providing a complete plan, set the optional needs_more_exploration parameter.`,
