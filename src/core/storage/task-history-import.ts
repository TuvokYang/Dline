/**
 * Import a legacy `taskHistory.jsonl` into the SQLite-backed history.
 *
 * The legacy file is append-structured, so a task can appear on many lines. The
 * later line always supersedes the earlier one; reading it in any other order is
 * exactly the defect this migration repairs, so the collapse below must follow
 * file order and must not sort by timestamp first.
 *
 * The history is a derived index over `tasks/<id>/`, so a failed import is not
 * data loss: the file is left in place and the user can rebuild the index. Only
 * a successful import removes the legacy file.
 *
 * @param history Destination store, expected to be empty.
 * @param legacyPath Absolute path to the legacy `taskHistory.jsonl`.
 * @returns Number of imported tasks, or 0 when there was nothing to import.
