/**
 * Permission attributes for agent ignore files.
 *
 * A plain ignore file can only say "excluded" or "not excluded", which forces
 * one decision onto every operation. Listing a huge generated tree and opening
 * one named file inside it have very different costs and very different risks,
 * so a single boolean cannot express what a project actually wants.
 *
 * An `.agentignore` line may therefore carry trailing attributes that remove
 * individual permissions, following two established conventions: attributes sit
 * after the pattern as in `.gitattributes`, and `-x` removes a permission as in
 * `chmod`.
 *
 * ```gitignore
 * secrets/            # no attributes: every permission is removed
 * tmp/          -s    # hidden from listings, still readable and writable
 * vendor/       -w    # read-only
 * build/        -s -w # hidden and read-only
 * coverage/     -sw   # the same, written compactly
 * ```
 *
 * Keeping the attributes at the end means the pattern reaches the matcher
 * untouched, so negation, globs and escapes keep their exact gitignore meaning.
