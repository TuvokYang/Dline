/**
 * InProcessLockManager — Process-Level Checkpoint Lock (VS Code)
 *
 * Implements ICheckpointLockManager for VS Code environments where
 * cross-process locking (SqliteLockManager) is unavailable. Delegates
 * to CheckpointMutexRegistry, which maintains a per-cwdHash Mutex pool
 * backed by p-mutex.
 *
 * This ensures that within a single VS Code process, all checkpoint
 * operations targeting the same shadow git repository are serialized,
 * preventing race conditions between concurrent Tasks (parent + spawned
 * children).
 *
 * Limitation:
 * - Does NOT protect against concurrent VS Code windows (separate
 *   Node.js processes). For cross-process serialization, the
 *   SqliteLockManager (standalone/CLI) path is required.
