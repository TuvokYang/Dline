 *   - Global:  ~/Documents/dline/workflows/
 *
 * Discovery is read-only: it reports what exists on disk and resolves the
 * effective state against stored preferences in memory. Persisting a preference
 * is reserved for explicit user toggles, so this stays off the storage write
 * path and never contends for the cross-process settings lock.
