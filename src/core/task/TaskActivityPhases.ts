/**
 * Phases in which the task loop still owns the conversation.
 *
 * A working task drives itself: it reaches the next provider request, tool
 * round or turn end on its own, without a user response. `BETWEEN_TURNS` in
 * particular is *not* an idle state — it is the gap between one finished turn
 * and the next provider request, and the loop in `initiateTaskLoop` is still
 * running through it. Treating that gap as "idle" lets the composer send input
 * into a conversation that has nobody waiting to receive it.
 *
 * Waiting for the user is expressed by an active interaction, never by a phase
 * on this list. `AWAITING_APPROVAL` is therefore absent: the task is parked on
 * an interaction that owns its own actions. That phase is still allowed to
 * *retain* queued input, which is a wider question answered separately by
 * `taskPhaseStillDelivers` in `@shared/InputQueueDelivery`.
 *
 * Written as an explicit list rather than as a negation of the terminal phases:
 * a newly added phase must opt in to being considered working, instead of
 * silently inheriting it.
