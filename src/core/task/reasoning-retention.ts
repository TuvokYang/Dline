/**
 * Accumulation policy for encrypted provider reasoning blocks.
 *
 * The Responses API streams one reasoning item as a sequence of events. Its
 * `response.output_item.added` payload is an in-progress snapshot whose `encrypted_content` may
 * still be incomplete, while `response.output_item.done` carries the authoritative payload that a
 * later request must replay. Treating every snapshot as a new block therefore records the same
 * reasoning item dozens of times and inflates one assistant message far beyond any compaction Pass.
 *
 * Snapshots are still worth keeping: when a stream is interrupted before `done`, the newest
 * snapshot is the only encrypted reasoning available for recovery. So snapshots refresh in place
 * per item id — the same partial/final contract used elsewhere in the task runtime — instead of
 * appending.
