/**
 * Presentation policy for the streaming "thinking" indicator.

 * Providers expose reasoning in two shapes:
 *  - plain text reasoning, which can be rendered verbatim;
 *  - opaque encrypted reasoning (carried as `redacted_thinking` blocks), whose
 *    payload must never be shown but still means the model is actively working.
 *
 * Both shapes drive the same UI row. This module owns the decision of when that
 * row opens, when it is promoted to real text, and when an indicator that never
 * received text has to be withdrawn, so the streaming loop only executes the
 * resulting action.
