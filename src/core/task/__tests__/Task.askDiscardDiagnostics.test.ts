/**
 * A response that reaches the task with no ask listening used to leave a log
 * that named the symptom and nothing else. Locating the cause then required
 * inferring the conversation position and runtime phase from surrounding
 * timestamps, which is exactly what a multi-hour hang makes impossible.
 *
 * These tests pin the fields the diagnostic must carry, and pin that the
 * diagnostic survives a task whose state is not fully reportable. The path is
 * already anomalous; a formatter that threw would replace the report with its
 * own failure and destroy the evidence it exists to preserve.
