/**
 * Coalesce concurrent capability discovery scans that belong to one controller.
 *
 * The capability panel polls several independent refresh RPCs on short timers
 * while task startup and state publishes trigger the same scans again. On a
 * large workspace a single scan can take seconds, so without coalescing dozens
 * of identical filesystem walks pile up and saturate the shared libuv thread
 * pool, which then delays unrelated I/O such as checkpoint Git work.
 *
 * Only in-flight work is shared; nothing is cached. Once a scan settles the
 * slot is released, so the next caller always starts a fresh scan and observes
 * current disk state.
 *
 * Entries are keyed per controller because discovery resolves against that
 * controller's stored preferences, and are held in a WeakMap so a disposed
 * controller does not keep its pending scans reachable.
