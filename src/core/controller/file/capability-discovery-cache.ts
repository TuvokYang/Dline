/**
 * Which locally discovered resources exist, per capability kind.
 *
 * The state push has to tell the webview which resources exist, but discovery
 * runs in its own RPCs and preferences are stored as sparse overrides — an
 * absent path there means "inherit", not "missing". Publishing the override map
 * alone would therefore show an empty list until the user toggled something.
 *
 * The previous build avoided that by letting each scan write its full result
 * back into the preference store, which is exactly how an incomplete scan after
 * an update could erase a user's disabled entries. This module keeps the two
 * facts separate: discovery says what exists, the scope chain says what the
 * user decided, and the state push combines them.
 *
 * Two properties matter for the panel to stay stable:
 *
 *   - A scan that could not read a directory is rejected, so a transient
 *     failure cannot blank the list.
 *   - The last trustworthy result is mirrored into workspace state, so a
 *     restart shows the previous set instead of an empty panel until the first
 *     scan settles.
 *
 * The mirror is a display cache, never a preference: a stale entry can only
 * show one extra row until the next scan, and it never changes an enabled
 * state, because the scope chain remains the sole source of user intent.
