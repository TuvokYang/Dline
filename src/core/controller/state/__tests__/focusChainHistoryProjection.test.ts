 * The focus chain history file is append-only and was projected into state in
 * full, so every state push rebroadcast the entire history. Field logs showed
 * ~12.5 MB payloads repeating several times a second across concurrent tasks,
 * with the extension host serializing each one on the main thread.
 *
 * The webview parses this text into entries delimited by `## Completed`
 * headings, so these tests pin that the projection cuts on those boundaries —
 * a byte-level cut would leave a partial entry that renders as a truncated
 * checklist rather than as absent history.
