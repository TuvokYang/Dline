/**
 * Write the current session's diagnostic bundle under the Dline data directory.
 *
 * The archive lands in a fixed directory next to the telemetry journals it is
 * built from, rather than at a path the user picks. A save dialog is modal: it
 * turns "give me my diagnostics" into a second decision at the moment something
 * is already wrong, and an unanswered dialog leaves the caller waiting with no
 * way to tell that apart from a slow export. A known directory is also easier
 * to name in a bug report than whatever path a user chose.
 *
 * The command lives here rather than in the telemetry package because it needs
 * the extension's version, which the package must not depend on. Keeping the
 * direction that way lets the exporter stay testable without a host.
 *
 * Raw artifacts are never attached. The request carries the flag so the
 * contract is stable, but honouring it requires a confirmation UI that names
 * the files being attached; until that exists, silently including raw content
 * because a boolean was set would defeat the export's privacy default.
