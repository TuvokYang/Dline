/**
 * Bug repro: When `reRenderUpdatedPartialBlocks` has already executed a tool's
 * complete handler (lifecycle === "complete-done"), `presentAssistantMessage`'s
 * switch statement must NOT execute it again.  Otherwise the tool runs twice,
 * and for replace_in_file the second execution fails with "SEARCH not found"
 * because the file was already modified.
 *
 * This test verifies that the lifecycle state machine correctly prevents
 * double execution in the deferred complete path.
