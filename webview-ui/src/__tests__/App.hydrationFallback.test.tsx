/**
 * A panel that renders nothing is indistinguishable from a broken extension.
 *
 * The webview used to return `null` until the first state payload arrived, so
 * a failed subscription, a stream that closed early and a merely slow start
 * all produced the same blank view — with the only trace in a console the
 * reporting user cannot be asked to open.
 *
 * These tests pin that each of those states renders something, that the
 * failure says why, and that the retry is wired to an actual re-subscription.
