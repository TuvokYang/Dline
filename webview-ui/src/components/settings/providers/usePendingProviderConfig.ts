/**
 * Keeps provider-config edits from overwriting each other while the profile
 * round-trips through the backend.
 *
 * Provider components derive their config from the `profile` prop and publish
 * changes as a whole replacement object, for example
 * `onUpdate({ openai: { ...config, pricing } })`. Settings inputs are debounced
 * and each field commits on its own timer, so a second field can commit long
 * before the prop carries the first one. Rebuilding from the prop during that
 * window silently drops the earlier edit.
 *
 * `latest()` returns the config an update should be built from: the most
 * recently published value while the prop still lags behind it, otherwise the
 * prop. The recorded value is released once the prop reflects every field it
 * carried, or when the edited profile changes, so reloads and profile switches
 * still win.
 *
 * @param profileId Identifies the profile the config belongs to.
 * @param config Provider config derived from the current `profile` prop.
 * @returns The config to render, a `latest` reader, and a `publish` recorder.
