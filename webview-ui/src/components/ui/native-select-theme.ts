 * Theme tokens for native `<select>` controls.

 * inherit Tailwind classes or CSS applied through class selectors. Without an explicit
 * background/foreground on the element and on every `<option>`, the popup falls back to
 * the browser default light palette, which is unreadable inside a dark VS Code theme.
 * Apply these styles inline to keep native dropdowns aligned with the active theme.
